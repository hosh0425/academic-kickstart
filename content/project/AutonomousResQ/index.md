This video demonstrates our autonomous rescue robot in Iran Open 2015 competition.
All of these algorithms are written in ROS frame work.

Main tasks:
1. Hector SLAM used for mapping and localization
2. Frontier algorithm is used for exploration
3. Dijkstra is used for robots navigation
4. ORB-SLAM is used to track the previous wave points
5. RTABMAP is used to generate a 3D map of the environment
