This video briefly demonstrates what I have done as my bachelor thesis.
The primary purpose of path planning for UAVs,
which is a necessary prerequisite toward an autonomous UAV is
to reach the robot to the predefined target while the chosen path
is optimized. This paper addresses the problem of path planning
for an unmanned aerial vehicle in a 2D indoor environment by
considering motion uncertainty. To cope with this, we formulate
the problem in three sub-parts. A vision-based EKF is used
to localize the UAV in the environment. To overcome motion
uncertainty, we consider the problem as an MDP problem.

Finally, a DFL based switching controller is used for both point-
to-point and also path controller. In the end, we present the

results of applying the proposed algorithms on a simulated and
also real UAV.
