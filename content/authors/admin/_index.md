<div style="text-align:justify">I am a research assistant in <a href="http://ramp.ensc.sfu.ca/">Robotics Algorithms and Motion Planning (RAMP) Lab</a> under supervision of Prof. Kamal Gupta and Prof. Mehran Mehrandezh, since 2020. My research interest is mainly about robotics perception. During my master program I am going to consolidate path planning, deep CNN and deep RL algorithms to build an autonomous industrial mobile robot.</div>



<div style="text-align:justify">Also, I got my bachelor in computer engineering at K.N. Toosi University of Technology in Iran. In KNTU,  I was a member of <a href="https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/">Advanced Robotic and Automated Systems (ARAS)  Lab</a> under the supervision of Prof. Hamid D. Taghirad and a member of computer vision and AI group at MAV team and UGV team in the <a href=http://kn2c.aras.kntu.ac.ir/>KN2C robotic team</a> as well.</div>
