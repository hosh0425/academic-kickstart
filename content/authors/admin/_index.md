I am a research assistant in [Robotics Algorithms and Motion Planning (RAMP) Lab](http://ramp.ensc.sfu.ca/) under supervision of Prof. Kamal Gupta and Prof. Mehran Mehrandezh, since 2020. My research interest is mainly about robotics perception. During my master program I am going to consolidate path planning, deep CNN and deep RL algorithms to build an autonomous industrial mobile robot in a factory.

Also, I got my bachelor in computer engineering at K.N. Toosi University of Technology in Iran. In KNTU, I was a member of [Advanced Robotic and Automated Systems (ARAS) Lab](https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/) under the supervision of Prof. Hamid D. Taghirad and a member of computer vision and AI group at MAV team and UGV team in the [KN2C robotic team](http://kn2c.aras.kntu.ac.ir/) as well.
